# Oliver-the-Content-Poster
Oliver is a personal productivity assistant I built to help streamline my content creation workflow. 
This application allows me to upload and publish videos to my own TikTok account using the TikTok Content 
Posting API through an automation platform (n8n). 

The app is used only by me. It does not provide services to third parties and does not manage or collect 
data from any other TikTok users. Oliver helps me automate posting schedules for my accounts 
@notionwithro and @aurrora.borrealis by integrating TikTok uploads with my Telegram content schedule. 

No user data is stored or shared, and the application is strictly for personal productivity and content 
management.
