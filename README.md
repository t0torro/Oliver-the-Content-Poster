# Oliver Productivity Assistant

Oliver is a personal productivity automation tool built to help manage and 
schedule my own content across platforms.

It integrates with Pinterest, TikTok, Telegram, and n8n to simplify uploading and posting 
content for my personal accounts, including @notionwithro and @aurrora.borrealis.

Oliver is used exclusively by me. It does not provide services to third parties, 
does not process data from other users, and does not offer commercial features.
